# Multivariate Analysis of Cereal Nutrient Data

## Overview  
This project performs multivariate statistical analysis on cereal nutrient data. Techniques include Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for variable importance, tests for multivariate normality, and Discriminant Analysis for classification.

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and exploration.  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  
- Tests for multivariate normality.  
- Discriminant Analysis for classification.  

## Installation  

Make sure you have R installed. You can install required packages using:

```r
install.packages(c("library1_name","library2_name",......))
```
